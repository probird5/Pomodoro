## Features

- Dynamic countdown display.
- Timer expiration notification.
- Support for pausing the timer using the spacebar.
- Support for manually ending the timer using Ctrl+C.

2. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):

`gcc pomodoro.c -o pomodoro`


3. Run the program:

`./pomodoro`


4. Follow the prompts to enter the desired work and break durations (in minutes).
